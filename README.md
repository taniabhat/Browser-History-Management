Browser History Management: 
This project is a command-line application developed in C++ as a training course to demonstrate the practical application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It was designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world software design.

##Key Features:
* Visit New Pages: Add a new URL to the browsing history.
* Two-Way Navigation: The advanced implementation uses a doubly linked list , which allows for navigating backward and forward through history using back() and forward() functions.
* Dynamic History: Unlike a fixed-size array, the doubly linked list implementation allows the history to grow dynamically without a fixed size limit.
* Clear Display: The application can display the user's current page and a full view of the browsing history.
* Object-Oriented Design: The project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Technologies Used:
Language: C++.
Concepts: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Pointers.
Data Structures: Stack, Doubly Linked List.

How to Run
To compile and run this program, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++).

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:
cd browser-history-management

Compile the source code:
g++ -o browser_history main.cpp

Run the executable:
./browser_history

Future Enhancements:
Persistence: Implement file I/O to save and load browsing history.
GUI: Create a graphical user interface for a more intuitive user experience.
Search Function: Add the ability to search for specific URLs within the history.
